<h2>Chichewa speech-dataset(On-going)</h2>
<b>Description</b>
This project aims to build a high-quality TTS model for Chichewa. So far, we have successfully collected and processed 4 hours of transcribed speech data, a foundational step in this initiative. However, significantly more data is required for robust, natural-sounding synthesis. We aim to develop a dataset of 50 hours as studies in speech synthesis (e.g., Tacotron 2, FastSpeech) indicate that high-quality, intelligible TTS models typically require at least 50-100 hours of clean, annotated speech. For low-resource languages, training with smaller datasets (e.g., 4-10 hours) results in poor pronunciation, unnatural prosody, and limited generalisation.
